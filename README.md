# FlyUp
*Winning Project to Silicon Valley - FlyUp (A social media for strangers)* . 

This is a project I did when I was in my Form 4 (16 years old) for a national-level coding bootcamp (D-CODE).  
Inspired by one of the ice-breaking games during the bootcamp, I decided to make it into a website.  
This is a client-side-only application and it uses HTML, CSS, JS and jStorage to run.  

Enjoy!
